# Remote Backend Configuration
# S3 for state storage + DynamoDB for state locking
#
# SETUP:
# 1. First run bootstrap/ to create your state bucket (see bootstrap/README.md)
# 2. Copy this file to backend.tf
# 3. Replace the bucket name with your unique bucket name from bootstrap

terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket               = "REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-STATE-BUCKET-NAME"  # e.g., "wikiguard-<unique-id>-state"
    key                  = "terraform.tfstate"
    region               = "us-east-1"                      
    encrypt              = true
    dynamodb_table       = "wikiguard-terraform-lock"
    workspace_key_prefix = "workspaces"             
  }
